# Notes on Data Preparation

## Database Collection

See this [repository](https://github.com/godweiyang/wechat-explore) and its attached link.

## Data Processing

There are many ways to process original WeChat data. The python code attached at this repository requires SQLcipher to connect to the encrypted database. I personally downloaded SQLCipher and installed on my Linux machine, then process the whole dataset by Python and SQL.
